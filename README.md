# SOS_Morse_Code_LED_Blinking_Simulation
This is a beginner-level Arduino Basic project for converting a text message to SOS Morse Code and simulating the code using LEDs.
Here, I've used LEDs, Arduino UNO R3, a Breadboard, resistors, and C++ coding for simulation control.

N.B.: You must use the Serial Monitor to provide input and output texts and connect to your circuit.
